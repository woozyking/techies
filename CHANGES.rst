Changelog
---------

0.1.4 (2014-01-22)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Added ``StateCounter``, a state counter based on Redis ``Hash``. To
   see an example of its usage, see
   ```tidehunter`` <https://github.com/woozyking/tidehunter#example-2-without-limit>`__.
-  Included ``hiredis`` in requirements.txt for added performance gain.

0.1.3 (2014-01-20)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Added ``QueueHandler``, inherits standard ``logging.Handler`` that
   ``emit`` to any standard ``Queue`` compatible implementations,
   including all the ``Queue`` implementations in this library
-  Exposed direct accessibility of all intended APIs, for example,
   ``from techies import Queue``; or if you will,
   ``from techies import *``
-  Behavior of ``CountQueue.get`` has changed from just returning the
   item value to a ``tuple`` of item value and its number of appearances
   in the queue, eg: ``('dota', 2)``; an empty ``tuple`` is returned
   when the ``CountQueue`` is empty

0.1.2 (2014-01-17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Added ``CountQueue``, inherits ``UniQueue`` but the score is used as
   a count of item appearance, that the item has the highest count gets
   placed in front to be ``get`` first
-  Behavior of all ``Queue`` and its subclasses' ``put`` and
   ``put_nowait`` methods changed from return certain value to not
   return anything (more Python standard Queue like)

0.1.1 (2014-01-16)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Python 3.2 and 3.3 supported now
-  Behavior of both ``Queue`` and ``UniQueue``'s ``get`` method changed
   from returning ``None`` to empty "native string" (unicode for Python
   2.x, str for Python 3.x) when attempting to dequeue from an empty
   queue

0.1.0 (2014-01-16)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Initial release with Redis backed ``Queue`` and ``UniQueue``
